.. rubric:: Motivation

pyLoad offers an comfortable and powerful plugin system to make extending possible. With it you only need to have some
python knowledge and can just start right away writing your own plugins. This document gives you an overwiew about the
conceptual part. You should not left out the `Base` part, since it contains basic functionality for all plugins types.
