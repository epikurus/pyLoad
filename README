Description

To report bugs, suggest features, ask a question, get the developer version
or help us out, visit <http://bitbucket.org/spoob/pyload/>

Requirements
============

pycrypto: RSDF/CCF/DLC support
pycurl: lower memory footprint while downloading
pyqt4: for the GUI
django: for webinterface
tesseract, gocr, PIL: Captcha recognition

First start
===========

First, run
$ python pyLoadCore.py
to create initial config files.
You should now see a warning that there is no database for the webinterface,
so execute
$ python module/web/manage.py syncdb
and create the webinterface user.

Configuring
===========

After the first start, you can edit the config. Just open the config files
"module/config/core.xml" and/or "module/config/plugin.xml" with your
favorite editor and edit the appropriate options. For a short description of
the options take a look at <http://pyload.org/configuration>.

Adding downloads
================

To add downloads to pyLoad, add your links to "links.txt".
If you have successfully installed the LinuxFileEvents hook, pyLoad should add
the files to the queue automatically. If not, you have to restart pyLoad or use
one of the interfaces.
To starte the CLI and connect to a local server, run
$ python pyLoadCli.py -l
To connect to a remote server, run
$ python pyLoadCli.py
and fill in the connection details.
If you want to connect from graphical enviroment, you can also use the GUI:
$ python pyLoadGui.py
